# Creating security groups and rules
{: #creating-security-groups}

You can create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} security group and its associated rules and then assign it to the interfaces of one or more virtual server instances to enable a virtual firewall.
{: shortdesc}

## Creating a security group
{: #creating-a-security-group-1}

To create a security group, complete the following steps:

1. From the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/), click the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > **Classic Infrastructure** to get to the Classic Infrastructure landing page.
1. From the Classic Infrastructure menu, select **Security** >  **Network Security** > **Security Groups** to get to the Security Groups page.
1. On the Security Groups page, click the **Create group +** button.
1. Enter a name and description for the security group and click **Create group**.

**Create group with a default rule to allow all outbound traffic** is selected by default. You can clear this field to create the security group with no rules. A security group with no rules blocks all traffic (both inbound and outbound).
{: note}

## Creating security group rules
{: #creating-security-group-rules}

To create a security group rule, complete the following steps:

1. From the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/), click the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > **Classic Infrastructure** to get to the Classic Infrastructure landing page.
1. From the Classic Infrastructure menu, select **Security** > **Network Security** > **Security Groups** to get to the Security Groups page.
1. On the Security Groups page, click a security group name to open the Details page and click the **Create rule +** button.
1. On the Create Rule page, enter all appropriate attributes (such as direction, IP type, protocol, and source/destination information). When finished, click **OK**.

Selecting the optional source or destination fields restrict the new rule so it only applies to traffic to/from the specified source/destination. Source and destination fields can specify either a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block or a security group.
{: note}

A CIDR block facilitates routing of a block of IP addresses. If you select **CIDR Block** as the type, then you must specify an IP address range.

If you select **Security Groups** as the type, then you must select from a list of existing security groups. This selection allows any IP address from a device that is attached to the selected security group. If a virtual server is configured to have multiple IP addresses, only the primary IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are used by these remote security group rules.
