Predfined security groups
:    You can now add existing or predefined IBM Cloud Security Groups to instances during the ordering process. You can use security groups to enact a set of IP filter rules that define how to handle incoming and outgoing traffic to both the public and private interfaces of a virtual server instance.

:    For more information, refer to [Adding a predefined security group during ordering](/docs/security-groups?topic=security-groups-adding-a-pre-defined-security-group-during-ordering).
